# Web Development Project 4 - *VeniVici*

Submitted by: **Stephanie Hernandez**

This web app: **allows users to discover doggies from around the world and displays their images, along with a little information about the dog. The user can also ban attributes so that the discovery of dogs is more of your liking.**

Time spent: **4.5** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **Clicking a button creates a new API fetch request and displays at least three attributes from the returned JSON data**
- [x] **Only one item/API call is viewable at a time**
- [x] **API calls appear random to the user**
- [x] **At least one image is displayed per API call**
- [x] **Clicking on a displayed value for one attribute adds it to a displayed ban list**
- [x] **Attributes on the ban list prevent further images/API results with that attribute from being displayed**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple types of attributes can be added to the ban list
- [ ] Users can see a stored history of their previously viewed items from their session

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

- I had a challenge planning this project at first with my limited amount of time.
- It was challenging being able to implement the logic for the ban list because I ran into trouble using the map function. I'm glad I was able to find the errors in my logic and fix my syntax error.
